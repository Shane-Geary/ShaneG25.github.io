JavaScript- the programming language that loves functions! JS is what gives some of our favorite apps the handy features and functionality that has become like second nature to most people. If it wasn't for JS, we wouldn't be able to "like" someone's post on Facebook, comment on that Reddit thread or be able to navigate around our online profiles without the browser reloading or redirecting everytime we clicked on something. Well, we might still be able to do some of that stuff, but it wouldn't be nearly as streamlined. It would probably be a total headache!

In this language, almost all the code you write is encapsulated within "functions". Which are similar to "methods" like in Ruby but have different syntax. Functions can contain code like expressions, fetch requests, event listeners etc. A big difference in JavaScript form Ruby, besides the obvious of JS being for front-end development and Ruby being for back-end, is that JS can operate asynchronously. Meaning if it runs a bit of code that could take a while, say a fetch request to a server, it won't stop there and wait to move on until that request comes back, it will move onto to the next lines of code WHILE that request is still processing. This is why when you navigate to a web page that for example, has a lot of animations and gifs, instead of having to wait for everything to load while you stare at a blank screen (like things used to be not so long ago) it renders everything it can right away and shows you the webpage WHILE it finished loading up the rest of the more demanding stuff. All of this asynchronous code happens within Javascripts favorite thing... Functions!

JavaScript works phenomenally well as a front-end paired with Ruby on Rails as an API back-end. When having a Rails API hooked up and handling all the databse work, making fetch requests from JS to that API is a wonderous work flow. Using Fetch; The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch () method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. Meaning we could have a fetch request for some data from the Rails API and the function making the fetch will return that data to us in JSON format, making it that much easier to turn it into HTML that the user will see on their screen.

For this project build, I once again have used the same domain as my project prior. I feel in the end it will show a nice portfolio of the domain increasing in functionality and UI as I have learned new languages. The big difference this time is that I've leaned it more towards live events in general and not just specifically concerts. All in all, learning my first front-end language "JavaScript" was almost as daunting as first learning Ruby but as I began to better understand it, my curiosity has been peaked and I'm excited about what's next!
