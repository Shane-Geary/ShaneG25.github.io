"Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.‚Äù -plato

I don't think anything could describe the power of music much better than that. This is why I chose to do my project on music venues in Colorado, where I was born and raised. I wanted to create something that gave Colorado music fans a place to interact with their favorite venues and learn more about them. It has a command line interface that lets the user interact with it and choose from a list of options to get further information on topics they are interested  in. So if you were a concert attender/music lover that wanted to know about venues in Colorado and get information on those venues, then you would use this CLI app to do just that.

The CLI data gem project was the first time we were truly set out on our own to build something that functions with the code we've been learning how to write, specifically procedural and object oriented Ruby. We also had to utilize the beginning level stuff of HTML and CSS. This was taught leading up to the project in order to prepare us to scrape data from the websites we had chosen for our projects. It may have seemed daunting but it really re-enforced what we had been taught and gave us the feeling that we were in fact, learning how to program and create working applications.

Coming into the project, I was definitely hit with the intimidation factor. Starting with an empty file or blank slate and being asked to take everything I had learned and create something out of nothing was a challenge. It was almost like I couldn't pull the information out of my head to even start anywhere. I felt like I had learned so much coming up to this point and yet it made me feel as though I had learned so little, or at least hadn't retained things as well as I should've. 

I realized, talking to other students and some teachers, that I had likely flown through the course a little too fast. I found myself going back to study a lot of the OO concepts and beyond. Which isn't by any means a bad thing. However, I knew in hindsight, that if I had taken more time in the beginning of the course and really enforced those early concepts, then I wouldn't have struggled as much (or taken as much time to complete the project and get past errors). After some great teachers (and fellow students) helped put me on the right track with articles and videos to study, I was well on my way. 

The biggest problem I struggled with was probably the scraping of data. I got past this with some informative articles on scraping and guidance in some of the open office hour study groups provided for the project. Once I got that figured out, it was more or less smoother sailing. All of the weekly study groups were a vital resource. It's a great feeling when you get that last error fixed and your program is running the way it should, definitely something to be proud of.
